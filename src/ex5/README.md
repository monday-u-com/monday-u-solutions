## Fifth exercise solution

This is the solution for the fifth exercise

## Suggested scoring schema

- [ ] **(30%)** Installed Sequelize using cli (models,migrations,seeds and config directories exists, as well as '.sequelizerc' file)
- [ ] **(10%)** Item model - name and status
- [ ] **(20%)** Migrations are running successfully: two separated migrations: (1)creating table and (2)adding a status column
- [ ] **(30%)** Replace in-memory operations on items - save, delete, etc to use DB Item model
- [ ] **(10%)** Application UI contains the status column and every change is stored in DB

Bonus

- [ ] Using unique id on each item operation
- [ ] Using seed
- [ ] Add "Done" timestamp
- [ ] Add index to the Items table (which columns compose the index?)
- [ ] Add server validation - create a new item only if not exists (Use transaction)
- [ ] Add edit capabilities to an item (extra)
