**Step-by-step solution** appears in all of the code files (HTML, CSS, JS)

## Suggested scoring schema  

- [x] **(0%)** Import the relevant CSS (style.css) and JS (script.js) files - already done for you

- [ ] **(5%)** Add your app name in the top of the screen (see mock)
- [ ] **(20%)** Build the layout according to the mock. (background, centered white box, etc...)

Bonus **If done at least 2, mark V in 'Beast' column**
- [ ] Clear the input when a new item is added

- [ ] Add ability to sort the list by name
- [ ] Add task when enter key is pressed
- [ ] Add animation when a new item is added
